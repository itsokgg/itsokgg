## Hi — I’m Benyamin 👋

Curious, self-taught developer who loves problem-solving, building useful software, and learning new things. I come from a CS50 background, prefer Python as my go-to language, and I split my time between coding (web + AI), learning new toolchains, and training—running and strength work keep me sane.

---

### 🔭 Right now
- Learning **AI engineering in Python** and applying models to practical projects.  
- Improving project READMEs so others can quickly understand and run my work.  
- Exploring cross-platform mobile development with **Flutter** and building modern web apps (Django/Flask + REST).  
- Training toward running goals and lifting — I enjoy combining fitness and tech (training plans, tracking, tinkering with data).

### 🛠️ Tech at a glance
Python (strongest) · JavaScript · HTML · CSS · SQL · C (basic)  
Django · Flask · React · Jinja · Git/GitHub · SQLite · REST APIs  
AI/ML fundamentals (search algorithms, Minimax, CSPs, supervised learning) · TensorFlow / scikit-learn

### Selected projects
(Short summaries — some project READMEs live in each repo.)

- **[InvoGen](https://github.com/itsokgg/cs50w-projects/tree/main/project5)** — Django app for inventory, purchases, and sales; dynamic formsets and complex validation to track serialized/non-serialized items and margins.  
- **[E-commerce Auction Site](https://github.com/itsokgg/cs50w-projects/tree/main/project2/commerce)** — CS50w project (Django) with user auth, bidding, watchlists, categories, and comments.  
- **[AI](https://github.com/itsokgg/cs50ai-projects): Search, Game Playing & CSPs** — Implemented DFS/BFS/A*, Minimax agents for Tic-Tac-Toe/Nim, and a crossword solver using AC-3 (CS50AI coursework).  
- **[Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/itsokgg/cs50ai-projects)** — Classification models and a traffic-sign neural network (CS50AI coursework).  
- **[Natural Language & Parsing](https://github.com/itsokgg/cs50ai-projects/tree/main/parser)** — Context-free grammar parser using NLTK; hands-on with tokenization and parsing techniques.

### A little about how I work
- **Problem-first:** I like breaking hard problems into implementable steps.  
- **Practical learning:** I learn by building — small projects that solve real problems (inventory tooling, automation, small ML tasks).  
- **Readable code + docs:** I value clear READMEs and reproducible setup instructions so others can run and extend my work.
